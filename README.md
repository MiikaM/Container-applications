***Note!*** For testing the application it is assumed that you have Docker installed and you have a basic understanding of how containers work.

To test the container application done in this part clone the repo to your workspace and move to directory *"todo-app"*. Here you can run the docker command *"[docker compose|docker-compose] -f [docker-compose.yml|docker-compose.dev.yml] up"*.

The commands in [] refer to options for the command. If you want to run the development environment use the file **"docker-compose.dev.yml"** to run the command. This starts environments based on the **nginx.conf** file and runs the project by default at port 8080. 

This repo is forked from https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part12-containers-applications and the base implementation for the app has been developed by @Jakousa and @mluukkai.
